## Duel-based Deep Learning system for solving IQ tests

The official implementation of the Duel-IQ solution proposed in the article: 
P.Tomaszewska, A. Żychowski, J. Mańdziuk, **Duel-based Deep Learning system for solving IQ tests**, *25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (2022)*

\
In directory *duel_based_system* is the code that uses the data generated with the code in the directory *data generator*. 
The code for dataset generation is the one that was initially used in the paper: 
J. Mańdziuk and A. Żychowski, **DeepIQ: A Human-Inspired AI System for Solving IQ Test Problems**, *2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)*.
